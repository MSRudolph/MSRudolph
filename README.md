## Hi, I'm Manuel

I am a PhD Candidate at EPFL in Lausanne, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­  
Currently I am based in New York City as a student researcher at CCQ, Flatiron Institute ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸

My main focus are numerical tools for simulating quantum computers, preferably on my laptop ðŸ’»

Perhaps check out [PauliPropagation.jl](https://github.com/MSRudolph/PauliPropagation.jl), a library for simulating quantum circuits with Pauli-path methods.

If you are interested in my publications, you can find them on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rzXS-bMAAAAJ&hl=en).
